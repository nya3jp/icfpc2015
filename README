Natsubate!
==========

We developed various AIs and mixed them at the run-time to get better scores.
* Greedy AIs greedily put units at the bottom of the map / greedily erase lines / etc.
* Duralmin / DuralStarman chooses the best move according to tree search.
* Hasuta4, oh, guess what?
* Kamineko uses beam search.
* Yasaka tries to find appropriate line to erase units.
Final output from these AIs are merged by the control program `shinku`, and
`rewrakkuma` embeds names of unspeakables, preserving the move output from AIs.
* Trivial tries to fill rows leaving one line for inserting a bar empty.
